# Analog-Clock
Certainly! An analog clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a timepiece that displays the current time through the use of rotating hands, much like a traditional clock. The clock face is created using HTML and styled using CSS to determine its appearance, such as the font, size, and color of the clock hands and numbers. JavaScript is used to update the position of the hands in real-time, making them rotate and indicate the current time accurately. This type of clock can be a fun and challenging project for beginners to create, and can help improve their understanding of web development concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
